## Requirements

Supported target operating systems are >= Android 4.1 (API 16) and >= iOS 9.0. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS by default (tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to get around this).

## Building your first React Native app

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

- [Trying out React Native](https://snack.expo.io/BJ-uC-nrb)
- [Creating a New Application](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Adding React Native to an Existing Application](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html)


## How React Native works

React Native lets you build mobile apps using JavaScript. It uses the same design as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

With React Native, you don't build a "mobile web app", an "HTML5 app", or a "hybrid app". You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, or Swift. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

React Native lets you build your app faster. Instead of recompiling, you can reload your app instantly. With hot reloading, you can even run new code while retaining your application state.

React Native combines smoothly with components written in Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, or Swift. It's simple to drop down to native code if you need to optimize a few aspects of your application. It's also easy to build part of your app in React Native, and part of your app using native code directly - that's how the Facebook app works.

The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native.

## Full documentation

The full documentation for React Native can be found on our [website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). The source for the React Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, <https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website>.

The React Native documentation only discusses the components, APIs, and topics specific to React Native (React on iOS and Android). For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the [React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Getting Started

<!-- generated_getting_started_start -->

Install Jest using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest):

```bash
yarn add --dev jest
```

Or via [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

The minimum supported Node version is `v6.0.0` by default. If you need to support Node 4, refer to the [Compatibility issues](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/troubleshooting#compatibility-issues) section.

Let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a `sum.js` file:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js`. This will contain our actual test:

```javascript
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Finally, run `yarn test` and Jest will print this message:

```bash
PASS  ./sum.test.js
‚úì adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)
```

**You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!**

This test used `expect` and `toBe` to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see [Using Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers).

## Running from command line

You can run Jest directly from the CLI (if it's globally available in your `PATH`, e.g. by `yarn global add jest`) with variety of useful options.

Here's how to run Jest on files matching `my-test`, using `config.json` as a configuration file and display a native OS notification after the run:

```bash
jest my-test --notify --config=config.json
```

If you'd like to learn more about running `jest` through the command line, take a look at the [Jest CLI Options](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli) page.

## Additional Configuration

### Using Babel

[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is automatically handled by Jest using `babel-jest`. You don't need install anything extra for using Babel.

> Note: If you are using Babel version 7 then you need to install `babel-jest`, `babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge.0` and `@babel/core` with the following command:
>
> ```bash
> yarn add --dev babel-jest babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge.0 @babel/core regenerator-runtime
> ```

Don't forget to add a [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/) file in your project's root folder. For example, if you are using ES6 and [React.js](https://reactjs.org) with the [`babel-preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-env/) and [`babel-preset-react`](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) presets:

```json
{
  "presets": ["env", "react"]
}
```

You are now set up to use all ES6 features and React specific syntax.

> Note: If you are using a more complicated Babel configuration, using Babel's `env` option, keep in mind that Jest will automatically define `NODE_ENV` as `test`. It will not use `development` section like Babel does by default when no `NODE_ENV` is set.

> Note: If you've turned off transpilation of ES modules with the option `{ "modules": false }`, you have to make sure to turn this on in your test environment.

```json
{
  "presets": [["env", {"modules": false}], "react"],
  "env": {
    "test": {
      "presets": [["env"], "react"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: `babel-jest` is automatically installed when installing Jest and will automatically transform files if a babel configuration exists in your project. To avoid this behavior, you can explicitly reset the `transform` configuration option:

```json
// package.json
{
  "jest": {
    "transform": {}
  }
}
```

### Using webpack

Jest can be used in projects that use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools. Refer to the [webpack guide](docs/Webpack.md) to get started.

### Using TypeScript

To use TypeScript in your tests you can use [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest).
